/*
Question 5:Write a Java program to find whether a year entered by the user is a leap year or not.
What is a leap year?
To be a leap year, the year number must be divisible by four â€“ except for end-of-century years, which
must be divisible by 400. This means that the year 2000 was a leap year, although 1900 was not.
